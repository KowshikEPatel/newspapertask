                        it's not genuine, correct, or comprehensible Latin anymore. While lorem ipsum's still resembles 
                        classical Latin, it actually has no meaning whatsoever. As Cicero's text doesn't contain the 
                        letters K, W, or Z, alien to latin, these, and others are often inserted randomly to mimic the 
                        typographic appearence of European languages, as are digraphs not to be found in the original.

                    Presented with the actual content still not being ready. Think of a news blog that's filled with content 
                    hourly on the day of going live. However, reviewers tend to be distracted by comprehensible content, say, a random 
                    text copied from a newspaper or the internet. The are likely to focus on the text, disregarding the layout and its 
                    elements. Besides, random text risks to be unintendedly humorous or offensive, an unacceptable risk in corporate environments. 
                    Lorem ipsum and its many variants have been employed since the early 1960ies, and quite likely since the sixteenth 
                    century. But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and praising pain was born

                    there anyone who loves grief itself since it is grief and thus wants to obtain it"). It was found by 
                     McClintock, a philologist, director of publications at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia; he searched 
                     for citings of consectetur in classical. I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound
